This repository is a collection of analysis scripts for several [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/) character surveys that I conducted in a Discord server in 2021 and 2022. Data were collected via [TierMaker](https://tiermaker.com/create/genshin-impact-characters-13-792389) and aggregated in Google Sheets, then imported, cleaned and analyzed in R.

The results of the 2022 character surveys can be seen in these [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-yot-AZzXWTWmC8ebKG-qbUFTsET_OmpRlRU7Rz25ao/edit?usp=sharing), and the results presentation in this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/gFAR1b8LV0w).
